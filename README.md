The ANSI/ISO keyboard kit made using ONLY through hole components and inspired by the [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid).

Atmega328p with VUSB on [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

To alter the pcb use KiCAD V5.0 or newer as it already contains most of the libraries. The additional libraries are provided.
